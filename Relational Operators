A relational operator is a programming language construct or operator that tests or defines some kind of relation between two entities.
In java the symbols are denoted as follows:
> ---- (greater than)
< ---- (less than) 
== ---- (equals to)
!= ---- (not equals to)
<= ---- (less than or equals to)
>= ---- (greater than or equals to)
EXAMPLE:
class Main{
public static void main(String [] args){
  int a = 7;
  int  b = 23;
  boolean c = a<b;
  System.out.println(c);
  }}
