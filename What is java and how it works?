Java is a computer programming language that helps the system to understand the user.
Java is made in 1995 by Sun Microsystem led by James Goslin and now it is owned by Oracle Company.
Java is a widely-used, versatile programming language renowned for its platform independence and object-oriented design.
It is easy to maintain and handles the exceptions.
Java is designed to crate applications that are WORA(Write Once Read Anywhere) which can run on any platform by using JVM.
Java is employed in a plethora of applications, from web development (via frameworks like Spring) to mobile app creation (using Android), and enterprise-level systems (via Java EE).
JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.
The terme IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment.
Now let us see how the java works.
We need both java and javac for the complilation.
For every file we should give extension filename.java.
In java we use semicolons at the end.
To compile a java code we will write javac filename.java to check either the written code a correct code or wrong code.
Java Virtual Machine(JVM) works on Operating System(OS) and Operating System(OS) works on Hardware.
Java code is compiled into bytecode, which is executed by the JVM, enabling portability across different operating systems.
