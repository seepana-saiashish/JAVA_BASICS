If anything happens automatically it is known as conversion.
A Casting is an explict where we have to change it by some methods.
NOTE:
If we want to convert an integer to byte it will not work        ----  we have to do casting.
But if we want to convert a byte to an integer it is easily done ----  it is conversion.
Example 1:
class Main{
public static void main(String[]args){
byte b = 127;
int a = 258;
b=(byte)a; //here the casting have been taken.
System.out.println(b);
}}
Output : 2 (because here the 258 is converted to modulus of 258(258%) with the range of 256 hence the remaining value will be 2).
NOTE:
We can store the byte values to an integer ----- this process is called type promotion.
Example 2:
class Main{
public static void main(String[]args){
byte a = 3;
byte b = 100;
int c = a*b;
System.out.println(c);
}}
Output: 300 (but it is beyond the byte range but can be stored in the integer).
