When we want to combine and classify two relational operators we will use Logical operators.
The Logical operators we use are AND(&&) , OR(||) and NOT(!).
AND and OR are both known as short circuits.
The conditions for AND(&&) is:                       
                    Result 
           T   T      T
           T   F      F
           F   T      F
           F   F      F
The conditions for OR(||) is:                       
                    Result 
           T   T      T
           T   F      T
           F   T      T
           F   F      F
The conditions for NOT(!) is:                       
                    Result 
           T         F
           F         T
EXAMPLE:
clas Main{
public static void main(String[]args){
int x = 6;
int y = 9;
int z = 10;
int a = 22;
boolean result1 = x > y && z < a;
boolean result2 = x > y || z < a;
System.out.println(result1);
System.out.println(result2);
}}

Output:
false
true
