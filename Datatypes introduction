Database is a permanent (or) persistent collection of organized data,typically stored and managed electronically.
We store the data using the database.During the processing of the code we store the data in variables.
As we know that Java is a stronly typed language in the variables we will have different boxes like Strings,Integers and Floats.
We have different types of data types to store the data.
This data is mainly divided into two types those are primitive and non-primitive.
The primitive data types are Integers,Float,Characters,boolean.
The non primitive data types are Arrays,Strings,List.
The default value for the datatypes int,long,shortand byte are 0.
The sizes of the datatypes are as follows: 
for Integer -------- 4 bytes
    long    -------- 8 bytes
    short   -------- 2 bytes
    byte    -------- 1 byte(-127 to +128)
The default values and sizes for float and double are as follows:
for double ------- 0.0 L ---------- 8 bytes
    float  ------- 0.0 f ---------- 4 bytes
The default value for the Character is /u0000 and the size of the character is 2 bytes.
The Character in Java are represented within single quots ('').
The Strings in Jva are represented within double quots("").
The default value for the boolean is false and the size of the boolean is 1 bit.
