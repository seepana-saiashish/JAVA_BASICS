class Main{
public static void main(String[]args){
int n = 9;   //9 is stored in n
System.out.println(n);
}}
Output: 9 

if we want float in the place of (int n) give (float n = 0.0 f).

if we are given a Character and asked to incerement it then the code can be written as:

class Main{
public static void main(String[]args){
char a = 'd';
a++;          //the value of a that is d incremented by 1 so it will be e
System.out.println(a);
}}
Output: e

NOTE: 
To keep the binary value we should use int n = 0b101;(that is 5)
To use the hexadecimal numbers we wite int n = 00AC;
If we give the value of double n = 64;  ---------- the output will be 64.0.
