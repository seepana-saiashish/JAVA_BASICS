class Hello{
public static void main(String [] args){
System.out.println("Hello World");
}
}
In the above code the output will be Hello World.

Here we created a java code and we will hava a java compiler which converts the code to a byte code and the byte code will go to JVM.
Java Virtual Machine(JVM) says that we need to tell the system what is the first file last file.
In java programming language the first file must contain the Main method.
JVM should contain (public static void main) with arguments (String [] args) these are the signatures.
As we know that java is object-oriented we need a class to create the object.
Here while we are coding the above program Hello.class is created which is the byte code.
While executing the code we will use javac Filename.java for compilation and java Filename for ruuning the program.
When we want to run something we need a JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT(JRE).
JRE contains a set of libraries and Java Virual Machine(JVM).
An another important terminology is JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT(JDK).
Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software package that includes tools, libraries, and the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) necessary for developing and running Java applications. 
JDK comprises compilers, debuggers, and other utilities that facilitate the creation and deployment of Java programs.
WE LEARN AND PROCCESS THE DATA TO SOLVE REAL LIFE PROBLEMS USING VIRTUAL WORLD.
