We can add,subtract,multiply and divide the numbers by using the java programming.
It can be achived by using the following code:
Example:
class Main{
public static void main(String[]args){
int a = 2;
int b = 6;
int add = a+b;
int sub = a-b;
int mul = a*b;
int div = b/a;
System.out.println("The addition of two numbers is:"+add);
System.out.println("The subtraction of two numbers is:"+sub);
System.out.println("The multiplication of two numbers is:"+mul);
System.out.println("The division of two numbers is:"+div);
}}
Output:
The addition of two numbers is:8
The subtraction of two numbers is:-4
The multiplication of two numbers is:12
The division of two numbers is:3
